Brothers and sisters:

DO NOT FORGET TO:
    - Add sets & gets for every member!
    - Add operator<< when its rational to do.
    - Test every new function! Do not procrastinate (remember those days(```~~~~```])

Things to consider:
    * using smart pointers!
    * commenting reasonably
    * DO NOT BREAK THE CONVENTIONS:
        + most important part is to devide to big function to smaller functions;
